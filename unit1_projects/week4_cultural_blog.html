            <p class="question">Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</p>
            
            <p>I had an emotional conflict with my best friend, I had to move away for higher studies and she couldn't accept the fact that we would not be able to see each other for a long time.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="question">What was the source of the conflict?</p>
          
            <p>We met in a cooking class, we hit it off immediately we had the same interests, the same hobbies, and we were close friends for 6 years. We saw each other almost everyday; she thought we would lose touch, she wasn't supportive of my decision or my dream of pursuing higher studies.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="question">How did you handle that conflict?</p>
            
            <p>I tried explaining her as why it was so important, I would try and convince her as to why I needed to leave. I then showed her my acceptance letter.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="question">Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</p>
            
            <p>She refused to understand, we fought everyday. But then one day she saw my acceptance letter from the university and she understood the importance of the situation.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="question">If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</p>
            
            <p>I would have been more patient with her, more understanding.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What did you learn from this experience?</p>
            
            <p>I learnt how there are so many people who depend on you and your decisions, how your actions have consequences that are sometimes faced by the ones who care for you.</p>
