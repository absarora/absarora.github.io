          <h3>Google</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span>Google</span> is a website that sparks simplicity. It is very precise when it comes to results and also impressive when it comes to suggestions as one types the topic or word in the search box. Aesthetically, I find it very elegant. I always look forward to the google doodles and the interactive animation clips depicting specific important dates or personalities. I also love how it keeps finding ways to tweak very obvious challenges, for example when you are specifically searching for images and you click on a specific image, the image will enlarge, give you an option to take you to the website of the specific image and also show you a set of other similar images. It is easy to use and very straightforward.

          <h3>Amazon</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span>Amazon</span> is an e-commerce website that carries out complex tasks while maintaining a very humble and elegant look. The navigation of the website is easy and the general display of all the various elements on the homepage is wonderfully structured. It also tailors the content of the website using the usersâ€™ preferences or past purchases. Every time you search an item or a product you will also find a related product suggestion. Amazon has a two-fold purpose which it fulfills quite well. They are:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The user is able to quickly find and purchase products.
            </li>
            <li>
              The seller is able to quickly process online purchases and make a profit.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

          <h3>Codecademy</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span>Codecademy</span> is a website that gives online tutorials to programming beginners. It is aesthetically very modern and upbeat. It is extremely simple to use. It carries out a step by step process of teaching basics with the help of online code compiling. The website aims at helping the user as much as possible. It goes hand in hand with the interface and gives the feel of academic focus. The navigation of the website is quite practical. I personally feel very inspired after using Codecademy.
