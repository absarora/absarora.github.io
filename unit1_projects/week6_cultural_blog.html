              I was raised as a Sikh.</br>
              In Sikhism its customary to not cut one's hair; I tie my hair in a turban.</br>
              I have been discriminated against when I was supposed to enter a club.</br></br>
              <span>Is it something that affects me negatively?</span></br></br>
              Well I get angered at the audacity of people to disrespect my faith. I accept diversity, hence I expect acceptance too. However, I find myself pushing harder to prove them wrong, to show them that I am more than my faith, and to tell them that my roots are strong, roots I am extremely proud of. <em>I refuse to be defined by what people see.</em></br></br>
              What is a stereotype really?</br></br>
              It is someone's way of unofficially deciding who you should be. I refuse to be stereotyped. I have lived in U.S.A for a decade now. I find it rather odd when I find people stereotyping me. I got exposed to the best and worst of two very different cultures. So to the ones who cannot see beyond my Turban I will say this-</br></br>

              I am Beer Connoisseur and a Buffalo Wings Enthusiast, I am up for any kind of Sport, I love Photography, I have friends who make me feel loved and respected, I have a family that inspires me to give my best every day.</br></br>

              I am a son, a brother and a friend. That's all that really matters.
