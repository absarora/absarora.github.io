          <h3>Why is Javascript so popular in web development?</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Like HTML is for structure and CSS for design, Javascript is for behavior used to extend the websitesâ€™ functionality. </br></br>

<span>Javascript</span> is said to be, relatively, an easy language to learn for its syntax is much like English and it uses the DOM or a structured model which makes it easier to develop a script due to the prewritten functionality. </br></br>

Today, the use of Javascript is much heavier towards Web applications as compared to a website. </br></br>

Javascript is very popular among web designers and web developers and it is supported by all web browsers for the dynamic content to be executed on webpages. </br></br>

Currently, there are no web technologies that do not use Javascript. For example AJAX and jQuery are the most common web technologies used to produce a dynamic web design and web development. </br></br>
AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML, where AJAX is a group of technologies interrelated to create dynamic web pages; while, jQuery is a Javascript library used for creating animations and many other dynamic features for the webpages.</br></br>
