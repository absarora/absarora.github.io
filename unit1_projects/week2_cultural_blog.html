            <p class="question">Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</p>
          
            <p>I choose Mentorship mainly because I am part of a club that helps international students adjust to their new environment.This means I am with them from the time they need to be picked up from the airport to the time they need to move in to their apartments. They are far away from their families and I am there for them whenever they need me. I advise them on academics, love and whatever other challenge life throws their way. I am a responsible for them and their well being. That just gives me a great sense of fulfillment.</p>

            <p class="question">What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?
            </p>
            
            <p>The last topic someone asked me advice about was about moving away from family. It was for academic reasons and being someone who is very close to family, I just told the person to follow her heart and that her family would understand  and embrace her dreams no matter what.</p>
