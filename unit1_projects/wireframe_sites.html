            It solves all kinds of search queries. Google has a very basic interface. It has just one search box and few other links that take you to your google email, youtube etc. I didn't seem to find any visual challenges with this website.

            The problem being solved by Amazon is the buying and selling of products. Visually, Amazon is slightly cluttered and little confusing for someone who is new to online shopping might be slightly confused.

            Codecademy helps new programmers, understand the basics of programming. It has a very apt interface as it has a very smooth navigation. I didn't seem to find anything visually challenging with this website but I would prefer a dropdown menu in the navbar pointing to the type of technlogies it offers help in.
