    <h2 class="head">About myself</h2>
    <p>Born to a Sikh family, I grew up in the state of Punjab, India. Along with family, I moved to United States at the age of 15 and I pursued my high school education at Clovis West in Fresno, CA. I finished two years of an undergraduate degree in the field of Computer Engineering at Fresno State University; currently, I am working as an IT tech in the central valley region. Besides the love for computers, I am passionate about <a href="#teach">teaching/tutoring<a/> mathematics to high school students. In my past time, I like to capture nature in its true form while I also shoot portraits and do event <a href="#learn">photography</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 class="head">Background with technology and programming</h3>
    <p>During my time at Fresno State University, I learned the basics of C and C++ (operators, control statements, functions, arrays, etc.) Though, I did learn about pointers, classes, and data structures, I had a tough time understand these concepts and my knowledge regarding the same is a bit shady. Along with a friend, I developed a website using XAMP in Linux OS. We used Drupal, an open source CMS to complete the project. It was one of the highlights of my time as an undergraduate and what sparked my interest actually choosing a career path as a developer.</p>
