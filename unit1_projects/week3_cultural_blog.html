              Pairing seems like a great place to learn as well as teach to solve a given problem. The idea of driving and navigating works well to debug the code which helps to solve a problem, quick.

              The feedback I received was very uplifting. It was a great response from my peers which also gave me an incentive to continue to do well and collaborate with my peers more often.
              I did receive some constructive feedback which was very helpful to my learning and I look forward to keep those points in mind when I peer program, next.
              I have given feedback to two people out of five I have programmed with so far and I could only write positive about both of them. While I should be giving them critical feedback, I wasnâ€™t able to do so.

            <p>
              Overall, I believe that pairing and feedback is a key tool to succeeding at any given challenge. Pairing has, drastically, improved my way of learning and approaching a problem while feedback is great way to know as how you have done and the things you need to focus on for the future exercises.
